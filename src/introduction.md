# Introduction

This user manual provides comprehensive documentation for the polymer generation library implemented in Rust. The library is designed to create polymer structures from amino acid sequences, offering functionality for both generating polymers and writing them to PDB files.

Key features of this library include:

1. Efficient polymer generation from amino acid sequences
2. Handling of N-terminal and C-terminal special cases
3. Alternating conformations for improved structural representation
4. PDB file output for compatibility with molecular visualization software

In the following sections, we'll cover installation, usage, API reference, and examples to help you effectively utilize this library in your projects. Whether you're a biochemist, computational biologist, or software developer working with molecular structures, this manual will guide you through the process of generating and manipulating polymer structures using our Rust library.
