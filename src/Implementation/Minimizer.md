# Minimizer Structure Documentation

## Minimizer

A structure for performing energy minimization and conformational analysis of molecular systems.

### Fields

- `sample: Sampler`  The sampler object containing the initial molecular system and sampling parameters.

- `minimized: Vec<System>`  A vector containing the minimized molecular systems for each sampled conformation.

- `energy: Vec<f64>`  The potential energies (in `KCal/mol`) corresponding to each minimized conformation.

- `angles: Vec<Vec<f64>>`  The optimized dihedral angles (in degrees) for each minimized conformation.

### Methods

- `new` : Creates a new Minimizer instance initialized with the provided Sampler (`sample: Sampler`) and returns a new Minimizer instance (`Self`). The vectors for minimized systems, energies, and angles are pre-allocated based on the number of samples in the Sampler.

- `diff` : Calculates the energy of a given dihedral angle configuration using a provided function (`Arc<dyn Fn(Vec<f64>) -> f64>`) that calculates energy from dihedral angles (wrapped in an Arc for thread safety) and a vector of dihedral angles to evaluate (`Vec<f64>`). Returns a tuple containing the energy value at the given angles (`f64`) and a vector of energy gradients with respect to each angle (`Vec<f64>`). The function performs numerical differentiation of the energy function with respect to the angles and is executed asynchronously using `tokio` tasks.

- `minimize` : Performs energy minimization on all sampled conformations using the L-BFGS algorithm. Optimizes the dihedral angles to find local energy minima. Updates the minimized systems, energies, and angles vectors with the optimization results. The minimization is performed asynchronously using `tokio` tasks. Returns no value (async).

- `conformational_sort` : Sorts the conformations based on their Boltzmann weights at `300K`. Reorders the minimized systems, energies, and angles vectors according to the conformational weights in descending order. Higher weights indicate more thermodynamically favorable conformations. Returns no value (async).

- `write_angles` : Writes the optimized dihedral angles and corresponding energies to a specified file (`&str`). Each line contains the conformation index, energy, and comma-separated angles. Returns an async `Result<()>` indicating success or failure of the file operation.

- `to_pdb` : Writes all conformations to a PDB format file specified by filename (`&str`). Includes both the initial system and all minimized conformations. Each `MODEL` entry contains atomic coordinates and the corresponding energy. Returns an async `Result<()>` indicating success or failure of the file operation.

### Example

The following example demonstrates the usage of the `Minimizer` struct in a Rust program.

```rust
extern crate libdncs;
use libdncs::minimizer::Minimizer;
use libdncs::parser::FF;
use libdncs::sampling::Sampler;
use libdncs::system::System;

// Configuration
const NAME: &str = "DNCS";
const SEQUENCE: &str = "YGGFM";
const FORCE_FIELD: FF = FF::AMBERFB15;
const NO_OF_SAMPLES: usize = 10;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // System
    let mut sys = System::new(SEQUENCE, FORCE_FIELD.init());
    sys.init_parameters();
    // Sample
    let mut sample = Sampler::new(sys);
    println!("Generating Samples...");
    sample.sample(NO_OF_SAMPLES);
    // Minimizer
    let mut minimizer = Minimizer::new(sample);
    println!("Executing Minimizer...");
    minimizer.minimize().await;
    minimizer.conformational_sort().await;
    minimizer.write_angles(&format!("{}.out", NAME)).await?;
    minimizer.to_pdb("minimized.pdb").await?;
    println!("Completed!");
    Ok(())
}
