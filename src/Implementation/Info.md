Yes, you're right. Let me correct the notation. Here's the exponential series using the proper inline and display math delimiters:

The series expansion of \(e^x\) is:

$$
e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}
$$

This is a power series that converges for all real values of x. Let me break down some key points:

1. Each term follows the pattern: \(\frac{x^n}{n!}\)
2. The series starts at \(n=0\) (where \(0! = 1\))
3. This series is incredibly important in calculus because:
   - It's its own derivative: \(\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x\)
   - The series converges absolutely everywhere
   - When \(x=1\), it gives us \(e \approx 2.71828...\)

Would you like me to:
- Show how to derive this series?
- Demonstrate convergence?
- Work through some specific examples?
